The save command.

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?

Honestly everything was pretty confusing as I've never done something like this before. The homework and office hours helps a lot with understanding though. 

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?

It was pretty good! Everything except the last question was very doable. The last part required a little more Googling.
